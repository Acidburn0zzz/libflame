Thank you for deciding to try out the libflame library!

libflame is a portable library for dense matrix computations, providing
much of the functionality present in LAPACK. In fact, libflame includes
a compatibility layer, FLAPACK, which includes a complete LAPACK
implementation. The source code for libflame is hosted on github:

  https://github.com/flame/libflame

For detailed instructions on how to configure, build, install, and link
against libflame, please visit the UTCS libflame webpage:

  http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/flame/libflame/

We also encourage you to refer to the libflame reference manual. This
manual contains all the information you need to get started with
libflame, including installation directions, usage examples, and a
complete API reference. If you have LaTeX installed on your system, you
may simply change into the 'docs/libflame' subdirectory of the top-level
directory of the libflame source tree and build the document from its
source. If you do not have LaTeX installed, then you may find the
document through the libflame web page at the URL listed above.
