If you encounter trouble while trying to build and install \libflamens, if
you think you've found a bug, or if you have a question not answered in
this document, we invite you to post to our mailing list at:
\begin{Verbatim}[frame=none,framesep=2.5mm,xleftmargin=5mm,commandchars=\\\{\},fontsize=\normalsize]
http://groups.google.com/group/libflame-discuss
\end{Verbatim}
A \libflame developer (or perhaps a fellow user!) will try to get back in
touch with you as soon as possible.
