\index{\libflame!version numbering}

Each copy of \libflame is named according to a human-designated version
string, followed by a ``patch'' number that corresponds to the number of
{\tt git} commits applied since that version string (or tag) was applied.
For example, version 5.1.0-15 is 15 commits newer than the commit to which
the ``5.1.0'' tag was first attached.
Each version also has a unique SHA-1 hash, which is used when identifying
versions with {\tt git}.
